# QuackCalendar
ASP.NET Core web app using Razor pages interfacing with a SQL backend.

This is the main calendar view, where the month is drawn dynamically based on where the days of that month fall:

When you click an event on the calendar, you can view the details of it. You can then edit, delete, or return to the month view:

If you chose to edit an event, you can change the name, description, start time, and end time. Clicking save will update the event in the database, or cancel will return to the month view:
